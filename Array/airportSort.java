/*Airport security officials have confiscated several item of the passengers at the security check point. 
All the items have been dumped into a huge box (array). Each item possesses a certain amount of risk[0,1,2].
Here, the risk severity of the items represent an array[] of N number of integer values. 
The task here is to sort the items based on their levels of risk in the array. The risk values range from 0 to 2.

Example :
Input :7  -> Value of N

[1,0,2,0,1,0,2]-> Element of arr[0] to arr[N-1], while input each element is separated by new line.

Output : 0 0 0 1 1 2 2  -> Element after sorting based on risk severity*/
// This code can be written by three pointers also which is called Dutch National Flag approach or Algo.
